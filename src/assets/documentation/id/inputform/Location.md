The sun doesn't shine as often or as strong everywhere. Depending on where you live,
your panels will produce more or less electricity.

Depending on your current location, we determine how much sunshine (irradiation) is 
expected to reach your roof throughout the year, 
using the [global solar atlas](https://globalsolaratlas.info/).
