## Recommended number of panels

The recommended number of panels is currently limited by the amount of electricity you consume.

### Electricity Consumption

In your case, installing more solar panels means that you would start to produce more electricity than
you consume on average.
Because the national utility company (PLN) cannot pay you for the electricity you (over) produce,
this is not a financially attractive option.
