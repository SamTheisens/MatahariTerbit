## Recommended number of panels

The recommended number of panels is currently limited by your minimal monthly payment.

### Minimal Monthly Payment

PLN requires you to buy a _minimal amount_ of electricity that depends on the size of your connection.
You will need to buy this electricity, whether you use it or not.

It is _not profitable_ to produce more electricity than the minimal amount you have to buy from PLN.
This limits the amount of panels it is financially viable to install.

ðŸ‘‰ Your connection seems to be rather large for the amount of electricity you consume.
You could consider requesting a smaller connection from PLN in order to save money.
