## Location and Irradiation

The sun doesn't shine as often or as strong everywhere. Depending on where you live,
your panels will produce more or less electricity.

Based on your location, we determine how much sunshine (irradiation)
reaches your roof throughout the year,
using the [global solar atlas](https://globalsolaratlas.info/).
