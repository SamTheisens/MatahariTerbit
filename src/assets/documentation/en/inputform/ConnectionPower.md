## Connection Power
The maximum power of your electricity connection determines how many panels you can 
install at most. The power of your connection is expressed in _VA_.

You can discover how many _VA_ (Watt) your connection has, by downloading the [PLN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icon.pln123) 
app and registering your connection.
