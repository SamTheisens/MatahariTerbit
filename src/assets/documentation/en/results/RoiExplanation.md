## Payback period

There are many factors that influence the costs of a solar system.

### Example

| Description        | Quantity | Unit Price |      Total Price |
|--------------------|---------:|-----------:|-----------------:|
| PV Panels          |        8 |  2.865.000 |       22.920.000 |
| Inverter           |        1 |  7.496.475 |        7.496.475 |
| Cabling            |      20m |     46.000 |        9.200.000 |
| Mounting equipment |        8 |    450.000 |        3.600.000 |
| Installation costs |        1 | 15.000.000 |       15.000.000 |
| _**Total costs**_  |          |            | _**58.216.475**_ |

### Assumptions made for calculation
* Price of a panel (including all costs mentioned above) is assumed to be Rp. 7.875.000
* Inverters are expected to have a lifetime of 10 - 15 years. We have assumed the inverter to last 12 years.
* Solar panels typically have a warranty of 25 or more years. We assume their loss in efficiency to be 0,75% per year
